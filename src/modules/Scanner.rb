      # it avoids a separated button or check-box to determine the autodetection behaviour

      # Initially nothing is shown.
      # After the first "Restart Detection" only the other USB device with class 255 is shown.
      # This unexpected result makes the user think about what is wrong and he powers-on the scanner.
      # After the second "Restart Detection" only the USB scanner is shown.

      # After the second "Restart Detection" nothing is shown.
